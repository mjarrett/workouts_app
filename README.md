# My workouts web app

This was my attempt to learn php and backend SQL. It works! I'd still like to improve the interface someday.

To use it, go to [mikejarrett.ca/workouts](http://mikejarrett.ca/workouts) and sign up for an account. You'll be able to plan and track your workouts and body weight and see your progress over time.
